Howto install Merlin
--------------------

After unpacking the file type:
make
make install


Hopefully this will install merlin in /usr/X11R6/bin and the
characters in /usr/local/share/merlin. If this does not suite you you
need to edit the Makefile to fit your needs. 

Merlin has been built this way on both i386-linux and on a Netwinder
with a SA110 running arm-linux.

Cross compiling
---------------

Cross compilation is no problem. You need to edit the
Makefile. Edit INCFLAGS, LDFLAGS, CC and STRIP to fit your
system. Merlin has succesfully been built this way on an i386 using
arm-linux-gcc.


Swedish keyboard map
--------------------
If you prefer a swedish keyboard map (I know I do). Then comment the
USE_ENGLISH thing from the Makefile.
